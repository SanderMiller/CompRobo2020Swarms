## Project Overview
The goal of our project was to gain a deeper understanding of decentralized multi-agent systems and collective behaviour through the implementation 
of Boid's Swarming algorithm. 

## Selecting a Modeling Platform
We were primarily interested in analyzing the collective behaviour of a swarm. In order to minimize unneccessary complexity we looked for a platform made for agent-based modeling, rather than a physics based platform such as ROS. We ended up choosing [NetLogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/) for its built in graphical user interface and visualization. These features allowed us to begin working on the model behaviour on day one. Although NetLogo uses its own programming language, we found that the NetLogo [programming guide](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/5.3.0/programming.html) and [dictionary](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/index2.html) made the transition to a new language relatively easy.

## Our Agents

The agents used in our simulation have three properties, color, speed, and heading. They have no sense of their absolute position within the map.
They are also able to sense, localize, and transfer information to any other agents within a given radius.
